# Work-day-scheduler

A workday Scheduler made by using the new Date function to color code the text fields based on the time of day. Also saves all the user data to local storage when a user saves the specified text field.

This application uses both Jquery and javascript inside the HTML file to interact with the HTML and CSS scripts.
